What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates the .git directory, which will be used to track repo information.
It needs to be done... I guess so git can tell if you are committing to an 
existing repo or a new one? to build the file structure? Why not do all this
on the first git command?


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets you decide what files to commit or not prior to committing.
The working directory has all of your stuff whether it is in the repo or not.
The repository has only what you have chosen to add.
The staging area lets you choose wisely (and change your mind before committing 
if needed).


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add files to the staging area that have changes related to the other changes
in the staging area. Before committing, use git diff --staged to review your changes
and confirm that they are all related.
