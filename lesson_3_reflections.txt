When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Certainly I'd want a remote for sharing work with others. I also use several
    computers, and this would allow me to keep everything in sync across 
    machines. A remote would also allow me to sort of "publish" my work, so 
    people could see not just the final product but any of the steps along the
    way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
