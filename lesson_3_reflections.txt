When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Certainly I'd want a remote for sharing work with others. I also use several
    computers, and this would allow me to keep everything in sync across
    machines. A remote would also allow me to sort of "publish" my work, so
    people could see not just the final product but any of the steps along the
    way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    1. Someone else might be editing the code I'm working on, which could
    make things very confusing if what I'm working on changes while I'm in
    the middle of changing it myself.
    2. Pulling might need manual intervention - like when you can't auto-
    merge, and I don't want to drop what I'm doing at that moment to deal
    with it.
    3. Someone might commit something that introduces a bug that disrupts
    what I'm working on. I might want to avoid pulling changes until I
    know that they have committed a fix for the bug.
    4. Not sure, but maybe it is easier to back out changes in that way?
